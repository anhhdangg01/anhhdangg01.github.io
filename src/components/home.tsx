        I am passionate about UI/UX design and art! I believe expressing oneself by creating interactable 
        yet stunning interfaces for all kinds of people to enjoy is a wonderful experience. My goal is to 
        further enhance my personal skills and knowledge in UI/UX and art, in order to fully deliver that 
        experience to you.
